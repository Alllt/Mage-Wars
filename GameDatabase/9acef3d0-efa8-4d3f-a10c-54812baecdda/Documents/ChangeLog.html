	<strong>The Game:</strong>
</div>
<div class="body"><ul>
	<li> One of our intrepid players reported that during the roll for initiative, if both players rolled the same number, a tie, automation broke and you basically had to reset the game and start over. lettucemode jumped right on the problem identified the issue and this release should fix the rare case when this happens.</li>

	<strong>The Game:</strong>
</div>
<div class="body"><ul>
	<li> lettucemode’s keen eyes figured out that when a spectator was joining the game it was breaking some of the automated scripts like flipping the initiative marker and changing phases.
	He has done some work to resolve the issue for now. Please let us know if it resolves the problem or if you have any other issues</li>
</ul></div></ol>

<div class="section">

	<li> Card Proxies now work. F12 will turn on/off this feature in the Spellbook Builder</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="section">
	<strong>The Game:</strong>
</div>
<div class="body"><ul>
	<li> When you load you deck, if it is not Validated the cards are removed for the game, you will need to fix the issue with the deck and reload it or reset the game</li>
	<li> More Automation at Game Start – Once your spellbook is validated and you have selected your color, you will be notified to roll for initiative, after the second player has done so, the rolls are automatically compared and the winner is prompted to select the start player and the initiative token is then set accordingly.</li>
	<li> You can turn off the Burn Notification via the Automation | Toggle Auto-resolving Burns menu item</li>
	<li> Started work on improving how cards are handled, especially Enchantments, you are now prompted Y/N when you reveal an Enchantment. This can be toggled on/off via the Automation | Toggle enchantment reveal prompt menu item (looking for feedback on this)</li>
	<li> Fixed a situation for when you place a marker on an unrevealed Enchantment, it would reveal the card name to your opponent in the chat window</li>
	<li> Added additional notifications in the chat window so you can easily trace what has transpired during the game, like when you flip the Action Marker</li>

	<li> Taunt Markers are placed on Thorg and Sorsoksu when revealed</li>
	<li> Card Proxies now work, you will note some new columns in the Spellbook Builder (SBB), and those are used for this purpose. The layout of the columns has changed as a result. Let me know if you would prefer a different order, I will try my best to accommodate any requests along these lines, but we retain final ruling on items such as this.</li>
	<li> Alternate Play work has started. You can now flip the board over and use ACG’s Zone marker cards to layout your own board size. Many thanks goes out to ACG, he has made me several versions of the card with the Compass on it (flip the regular zone card to reveal the Compass card), multi-player (3+) does appear to work, though automation is not fully working when changing phases</li>
	<li> Spectating has been released for OCTGN as a whole and it works very well with the Mage Wars OCTGN module – please let us know if you have problems when people spectate</li>
