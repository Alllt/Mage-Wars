    <p>Players are free to ignore any automation but if you would like a little help with the book keeping follow the process below once the game has started:</p>

    <p>1. From the Game menu select Load Deck or press Ctrl+L, Pre-Constructed decks are included, you will find them in the Decks -> Mage Wars folder</p>

    <p>2. Once your Deck is validated you will be prompted to "Pick a color" your player is now automatically setup</p>

    <p>3. Initiative will be rolled automaticly and the winner of the roll will be prompted to select who will be the starting player.</p>
    	
    <p>4. The initative marker will automaticlly be flipped to the color of the starting player and the game is then advanced to the Planning Stage.</p>

    <p>5. Double click on any card in your hand area to prepare it for that round</p>

    <p>Notes:</p>

    <p>When you are done with a creatures action you can use the Ctrl+Right Arrow to let the other player know that you are "Done" (when playing in OCTGN this is typically considered between action phases)</p>

    <p>When you have completed all of your actions during a Game Round (Upkeep, Planning, Deployment, First Quick Cast Phase, etc.) press the Ctrl+Down Arrow Key and once both players have signaled that they are done with this key combination, phase management automation will take care of the rest.</p>

    <p>Place markers or tokens on cards by right clicking on the card and selecting the marker or token you want, or by using the associated keyboard shortcuts</p>

    <p>When using the phase management automation the Initiative marker is flipped automatically, markers on cards are reset, Burn, Bleed, and Rot damage is calculated and applied (during the Upkeep Phase), and Channeling phases are handled by the computer</p>

    <p>Have fun!</p>
