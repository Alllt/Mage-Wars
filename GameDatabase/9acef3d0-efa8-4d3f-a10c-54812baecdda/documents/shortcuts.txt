Instructions
===================================

Players are free to ignore any automation but if you would like a little help with the book keeping do as follows:

1. Load a deck prepared with the deckbuilder (preconstructed decks are included)
2. Right-click anywhere on the main screen and choose "Player setup"
3. Press ctrl+Down to activate phase management. 
   Each phase change after the frist planning phase requires both players to press ctrl+Down
4. Double click on any card in the hand area to prepare it for that round.
5. Place markers tokens with the right click menu or through short-cuts

When using the phase management the initiative, Reset & channeling phases are handled by the computer

Have fun!
