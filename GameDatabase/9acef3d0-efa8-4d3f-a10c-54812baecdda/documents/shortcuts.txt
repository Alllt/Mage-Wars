Instructions
===================================

Players are free to ignore any automation but if you would like a little help with the book keeping follow the process below once the game has started:

1. From the Game menu select Load Deck or Ctrl+L (Pre-Constructed decks are included in the Decks)
2. Once your Deck is validated you will be prompted to "Pick a color" your player is now automatically setup
3. Press Ctrl+Down Arrow Key to activate phase management
4. Roll Dice (F1) for Initiative - if needed flip the Initiative token by Right-Clicking on it and Selecting "Flip Card" 
5. Double click on any card in your hand area to prepare it for that round

Notes:

When you are done with a creatures action you can use the Ctrl+Right Arrow to let the other player know that you are done (you will then be in-between action phases)

When you have completed all of your actions during a particular phase (Upkeep, Planning, First Quick Cast Phase, etc.) press the Ctrl+Down Arrow Key and once both players have signaled that they are done with this key combination, phase management automation will take card of the rest.

Place marker on cards by using the right click menu or by using the associated keyboard shortcuts

When using the phase management automation the Initiative marker is flipped automatically, markers on cards are reset, Burn damage is calculated and applied (during the Upkeep Phase), and Channeling phases are handled by the computer

Have fun!
